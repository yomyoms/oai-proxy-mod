KeyPool and KeyProvider's similarities are a relic of the old design where
there was only a single KeyPool for OpenAI keys. Now that there are multiple
supported services, the service-specific functionality has been moved to
KeyProvider and KeyPool is just a wrapper around multiple KeyProviders,
delegating to the appropriate one based on the model requested.

Existing code will continue to call methods on KeyPool, which routes them to
the appropriate KeyProvider or returns data aggregated across all KeyProviders
for service-agnostic functionality.
